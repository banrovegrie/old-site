I am a computer science undergraduate at [IIITH](https://iiit.ac.in), advised by Prof. Shantanav Chakraborty and Prof Indranil Chakrabarty. As a research student I am interested in quantum computing, machine learning, programming language theory and quantitative finance. Also, I often go by my nickname Arjo and have aspirations in start-up, storytelling and stand-up.

Everyone has demons. Mine are anxiety, and inability to plan out my day or choose when to focus on what. In between mindbumbingly binging Netflix and procrastinating about working out, I try to catch up on reading fiction, history or philosophy.
