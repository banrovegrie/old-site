I am a Computer Science student at [IIITH](https://iiit.ac.in), currently working as an undergraduate researcher at CSTAR under Prof. Indranil Chakrabarty. I also often go by my nickname Arjo.

As a research student, I am interested in Quantum Information, Programming Languages (formal methods) and Machine Learning (statistical). I also have broad interests in Computational Complexity (and algorithm design).
