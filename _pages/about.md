I am a computer science undergraduate at [IIITH](https://iiit.ac.in), advised by Prof. Shantanav Chakraborty and Prof Indranil Chakrabarty. As a research student I am interested in quantum information, machine learning, programming language theory and computational biology. Also, I often go by my nickname Arjo and have aspirations in start-up, storytelling and stand-up.

Angels and Demons
-----------------

Everyone has demons. Mine are anxiety and inability to regulate my attention. But this has some perks too and being a jack of many trades is one. In between binging Netflix and backstabbing in Valorant, I mostly sketch, read fiction or solve puzzles. I also love thinking and reading about politics, history and philosophy. Programming is fun too; especially because it's a sweet mix of representing your ideas while building atop them.
