I am a computer science undergraduate at [IIITH](https://iiit.ac.in), advised by Prof. Shantanav Chakraborty and Prof. Indranil Chakrabarty. As a research student I am interested in <ins>Algorithm Design $\cap$ Mathematics</ins>. This intersection includes areas like quantum computing, algorithm design, programming language theory and computational economics. Also, I often go by my nickname Arjo and can be found doing stand-ups when bored.

Angels and Demons
-----------------

Everyone has demons. Mine are anxiety and inability to regulate my attention. But this has some perks too and being a dweller in many trades is one. In between binging Netflix and backstabbing in Valorant, I mostly write shitty music, sketch or solve puzzles. I also love thinking and reading about politics, history and philosophy. Programming is a major hobby too, especially because it's a sweet mix of representing your ideas while building atop them.
