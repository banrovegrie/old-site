I am a Computer Science student at [IIITH](https://iiit.ac.in), currently working as an undergraduate researcher. I am often found confused or making plans that I never stick to owing to my addiction of doing random things at random times. I also often go by my nickname Arjo and have aspirations of doing stand-up.

As a research student, I am interested in quantum computing, machine learning, programming language theory and quantitative finance.
