I am a Computer Science student at [IIITH](https://iiit.ac.in), currently working as an undergraduate researcher at CSTAR under Prof. Indranil Chakrabarty. I also often go by my nickname Arjo.

Other than Quantum Information, as a research student, I am also interested in Computational Complexity, Type Theory and Programming Language Theory. I also have broad interests in math and machine learning.
