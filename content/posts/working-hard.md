# Working Hard

<p style="text-align:right;"> From [ðŸ”—](http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html) </p>

> Some way to evade hard work through sheer brilliance? Nopes!

> There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability, practice, and effort.

> It's straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined, externally imposed goals.
> - Don't lie to yourself
> - Don't procrastinate (**Major issue** ðŸ˜”)
> - Don't get distracted (**Major issue** ðŸ˜­)
> - Don't give up when things go wrong. 

> MOTIVATION:  I can't be sure I'm getting anywhere when I'm working hard, but I can be sure I'm getting nowhere when I'm not, and it feels awful. 
Does this lead to self-bashing/ negative (??) ? (in extreme case)

> Hardy's take in *A Mathematicians Apology*:
>  I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any passion for mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most decisively. 

> Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how many hours a day to spend on it. You can't solve this problem by simply working every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there's a point beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline.
How can one introspect to decide the same? How can she/ he get feedbacks for the same is the important question.
> The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. 
> QoW decreases when working too hard.
> Notice when you're being lazy, but also when you're working too hard.

> Many problems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuff at the edges. Aim as close to center as possible **without stalling**.
> A deep interest in a topic makes people work harder than any amount of discipline can.
Pursue what you desire.
