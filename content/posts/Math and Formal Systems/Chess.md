### Openings and Control

- Knight loves the centre.
- Bishops love open diagonals.
- He who controls the centre is setting himself for a win.
- Castle early and castle often.
- Try to get more pieces to active positions.

- Remember, the game progresses with one move after another move. So, just as Capablanca, focus on your next best move.

- Whenever you opponent moves, try to asses their reasoning and how can u best respond. The response need not always be defense.
- Remember `scholar's mate` but also remeber not to be very tempted to try it always.
  If you utterly fail at your attempt at this, you would have missed some valuable chances of developing pieces ensuring a better mid control.

### Checkmating and Winning

- Most checkmates ought to be assisted and supported. Look for such possibilities.
- Rook roller: Checkmate with two rooks by pushing the rival king to the edge of the board.
- King and queen: When its only your king and queen against the rival king, try to push him towards the corner with your queen keeping a knight’s distance. Then pounce for an assisted checkmate.
- Rook and king: Shrik the box with your rook. If you can’t safely then move your king.

- Pricing:
	- Pawn = 1
	- Knight = 3
	- Bishop = 3
	- Rook = 5
	- Queen = 9

- The pricing of pieces will give you idea on whether or not to make a certain trade.
- An even trade isn’t bad. But try capturing with your least valuable piece first.
- When you are up in pieces trade. When you are down in pieces don’t.

### Tactics

- Strategies are long term. Tactics are short term.
- Hangings:
	- Kill the hanging pieces. Look for them.
	- Avoiding hanging your own pieces. Always ask if a move to a square is safe. Please don’t blunder.
- Count Captures:
	- Move your pieces in such a way that you have more defenders ensuring upper hand at capture counting in case the killing starts.
	- Similar idea works for attacking as well.
- Fork:
	- A great way to win material is to attack more than one piece at a time with one of your own. This technique is known as a fork.
	- Try to fork with a lesser valuable piece compared to the shit its forking.
- Pin and checks:
	- Make sure you are not moving any piece which has been relatively pinned by your opponent.
	- Win material by pinning your opponent. Or save your material using the same tactic.
- Pressure and piling up:
	- Keep making nastier pins by piling stuff up to a corner or choke point.
	- You can also pressurize your opponent by threatening to check or capture.

# Calculation
---
The calculation checklist is as follows:

1. Checks (for first three gotta check both sides)
2. Captures (count captures and hangings)
3. Threats (fork, pin, skewer or pressure)
4. Stop opponent’s plan
5. Improve my position
6. Don’t blunder (this includes when checking or capturing)
