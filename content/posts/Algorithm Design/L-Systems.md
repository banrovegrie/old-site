## Introduction

Remember MSE Logo? Well, ideally that's all you really need to understand the underlying mechanisms of any L-system.

But what is an L-system?

## Origin

Lindenmayer systems, or L-systems (as they are popularly known as), were created originally by the biologist Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968 as a way of formalizing patterns of bacteria growth.

Today, L-systems are an integral part of computer science. They are used as recursive, string-rewriting framework, commonly used today in computer graphics to visualize and simulate organic growth, with applications in plant development, procedural content generation, and fractal-like art.

## Formal System

Wikipedia defines L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar.

- A formal system is used to infer theorems from axioms according to a set of rules. These rules used to carry out the inference of theorems from axioms are known as the logical calculus of the formal system.
- A formal system is essentially an “axiomatic system”.
- So why do we need such a "system"?
- Life is messy and confusing. It is hard to describe even a small aspect of reality without an enclosure that allows the lens of logic to prevail. A formal system acts as this enclosure.

## Theorems, Axioms, Rules

- An axiom is a starting point assumed to be true in a formal system.
- A theorem is a string produced (proved) by the rules of the formal system.
- A string is simply an ordered sequence of M’s, I’s, and U’s.
- The rules detailed above are rules of production or rules of inference.
- A derivation is a demonstration of how to produce one theorem from another theorem.
