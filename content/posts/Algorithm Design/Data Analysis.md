1. Learning = Representation + Evaluation + Optimization.
2. Generalisation is necessary.
3. Data alone ain’t enough.
4. Overfitting will attack you from unpredictable places.
5. Intuition fails in high dimensions.
6. Theoretical guarantees are wobbly.
7. Feature engineering for the win.
8. More data beats better algos.
9. Learn many models.
10. Simplicity doesn’t imply accuracy (always).
11. Use Occam’s razor with care.
12. Representable doesn’t mean learnable (always).
13. Correlation doesn’t imply causation.
