### Don't criticize what you can't understand
---
Don't write what you do not — to at least a certain admissible level — understand. This reminds me of the line in Bob Dylan's song "don't criticize what you can't understand".

### My ideas from a dialogue between Bob Tarjan and Don Knuth
---
Well one thing that absolutely blew my mind was Knuth talking about Computer Science from the broad perspective of being a mathematician and scientist. It started with this question posed by Tarjan — Do you (Knuth) consider yourself as a mathematician, a scientist, an engineer a philosopher or an artist?

Knuth gave a very fine answer. He said that he believes science is that which is so well understood by us humans that we can code it up into a computer. However, very often we find our mind meanders around and stays a few jumps ahead which ultimately depicts itself as art.

He also exclaimed how mathematics and computer science are the only domains that exist in the realm on science yet are not directly based of nature and rather belong to worlds designed artificially by us (plug-in computational thinking vs mathematical thinking).

### On what engineering means
---
Zeeshan mentioned the meaning of the word "engineering" means "cleverness".

### Universe is a Search Problem?
---
Purpose of the universe: is the universe just another parallel process in some kind of interacting parallel processes working on a search problem?

### Measure Shoudn't be a target
---
Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.

In other words, "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Isn't it exactly what happened in MDL Project?

### On recent non-fiction books I love
---
I fucking love Scott Aaronson's book. Quantum Computing since Democritus falls in my Birth of a Theorem category. I absolutely love them.

Feynman's two autobiographical books, especially "What do you care what other people think" is a amazing motivator.

I guess I will talk about old reads which changed my perspective, sometime later.

A little off-topic but Lex Fridman's podcast has severely affected my life — in a very good way.

### Richard Borcherds interview
---
Try counter-examples and try proving at the same time, for sure either one will work out.

Mathematics is discovered. How? If there were another civilization that we come across, we shall share the same mathematical ideas — even though representations and formalisms might be different. Now my question is that — does it mean humans can serve to be "universal conscious machine" because they can do math?

"There are some mathematicians whose work I could have never discovered for myself — no matter how harder or smarter I worked — Grothendieck is one of them."

### On Technology
---
I want to be a Computer Scientist and an Engineer — not just because of my interest but also because I want to fight evil regimes and technology (not just mere ideas) is the greatest weapon against authoritarianism.

### On Fiction and Literature
---
Good literature helps you build your soul. Literature drives us through the ideas and problems a person is facing by standing on his or her foorsteps and thinking about choices and their effects — choices that you or I may never face directly but does help in thinking clearly about a ton of other choices that we shall come across in life.

### Denis Nardin on how to do math research
---
I liked how he mentioned the same methodology for learning something as Siddharth had suggested me. Be a cow, eat the main ideas, come back chew on them and maybe come back again and chew on other stuff (... till you understand).

They also talked about how important active listening and asking stupid question are. Also, while reading a paper do not have the target of completing proper reading of it, rather look for and understand what you are interested in.

### Why do I like Computer Science
---
I absolutely love math and there is no denying that. And, computer science is the kind of math I like. I love the fact that things which I am thinking about are generally implementable. It abides by laws of physics for sure but gives me a sense of more freedom and building.

Moreover, I believe that information and computation is as basic a quantity to the universe as energy or time (or isn't that just entropy ergo information).

I also enjoy thinking about constructs and what they can and cannot do. Such constructs are often obtained by either hacking (legit scamming) over the known realms of math and physics or by even crafting out new realms altogether.

Computer science also deals with looking at all processes through the lens of algorithms and information. Similarly, programming of computational systems also serve as abstraction, formalism and automation for any given system be it a physical or a mathematical one. I absolutely love programming! Its an art of the highest form, one that begs the question — whether God herself isn't but a programmer? Who knows? Maybe, one day we too can program intelligence!

Moreover, the foundations of computer science are intertwinned with the foundations of math, while even providing further understanding in the fields of physics as well as philosophy.

### Applied Research
---
The duality of "basic research — applied research" defines the cartesian axes of a forward looking research strategy.

I personally find myself suited for "theory driven hacking-intensive" research.

On that note, the topics I wanna mostly anchor myself to, for now, are:

-   Quantum Information Theory (with programming)
-   Algorithmic Optimization (with ml and distributed algos?? maybe)
-   Programming Language Theory (with theorem proving and logic and not compilers or coding)
