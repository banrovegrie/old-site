**Why set this repo?**

One of the major reasons for the sustenance of the human society is our ability to work together as one.

Sir Isaac Newton once popularly said, "If I have seen further then it is only because I have stood on the shoulder of giants".

Thinking along those lines, this notes repo is my attempt to learn writing academic notes online and share them to whosoever needs them.

Also, this repo is mainly for me to easily access some of my important notes; for obviously it is quite impossible to have more than majority of them online and public.
